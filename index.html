        <h1>Displaying Distribution</h1>
        <section id="top">
            <h3>What is a distribution?</h3>
            <p>A distribution is a visualization method that shows how data allocate or how data spread out in a specific range. Different distribution includes box and whisker plot, density plot, histogram, ...</p>
            <p>
                When discussing a distribution, there are 4 elements that we care about:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#Center">Level/Center</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Spread">Spread</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Shape">Shape</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Outliers">Outliers</a></li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="Center">
            <h3>Level/Center</h3>
            <p>The level is measures of central tendency, such as a <b>mean</b>, <b>mode</b>, or <b>median</b>. These elements are usually shown together to have a complete look at the data. I reuse the following picture from my previous prep but with the mean, mode, and median shown on it:</p>

        </section>
        <section id="Spread">
            <h3>Spread</h3>
            Spread of a distribution shows its dispersion. Here's a box plot that I generated online:
            <figure>
                <img src="Boxplot.PNG" />
            </figure>
            Here we can see that the data mainly distribute in between 5 and 13. The difference between two ends of the box is the <b>Interquartile Range (IQR)</b>. The verticle line is the median. So the spread helps us see the distribution of the data.
            <br />

        </section>
        <section id="Shape">
            <h3>Shape</h3>
            Distribution can have 2 types of shape:
            <ol>
                <li>Symmetrical<br />
                    Symmetrical distribution has its left half and right half are mirror images of each other.
                    <figure>
                        <img src="Symmetrical.png" />
                        <figcaption>A symmetrical distribution</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </li>
                <li>Skewed<br />
                    Distributions that are not symmetrical are skewed distribution. It can be skewed to the left (negative skew)
                    <figure>
                        <img src="Leftskew.png" />
                        <figcaption>A left skew distribution</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    or skewed to the right (positive skew)
                    <figure>
                        <img src="Rightskew.png" />
                        <figcaption>A right skew distribution</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    As you can see, the longer end (also called the tail) of the distribution determines which direction is it skewed to.<br />
                </li>
            </ol>
            So what can shape of a distribution tells us? We can estimate where the <b>mean</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>median</b> are for each type of distribution shape. For example, because the left and right halves of the symmetrical distribution are symmetry, itsthe <b>mean</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>median</b> are at about the same place. For skewed distributions, right skewed distributions will have <b>mode</b> &lt; <b>median</b> &lt; <b>mean</b>

                <img src="Rightskew_2.png" />
            </figure>
            and contrary for left-skewed distributions.

        <section id="Outliers">
            <h3>Outliers</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="Boxplot.PNG" />
            </figure>
            This box plot has the dots to the right of the whisker. The dots are <b>outliers</b> of the data set. <b>Outliers</b> are values that are far away from the main part of the distribution. This gives us a more visual way to see if there is any exception element.
